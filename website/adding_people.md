# Adding members

We use a slightly modified markdown format. Navigate to [this file](https://github.com/socdyn/sdl-site/blob/master/flask_app/content/people.md).

Copy the format for one one individual. Replace the name, interests, and photo location.

Make sure that ~~~ is before and after the entry, unless the entry is the first or last. The triple-tilde tells a parser when an entry begins or ends.

You can easily move people between current and former members by changing `&current&` to `&former&` without changing the position of the entry.
